Meeting Schedule
    We have decided we can meet on these days below:
    - Monday/Wednesday: 3:00pm to 3:20pm,  
    - Friday 2:00pm to 2:20pm.

Time Commitment
    - Daily Scrum meetings (20 minutes)
    - Lab Meetings (2 Hours)
    - At least 1 hour a day for each member working on their tasks, in case we need more time we will update this to be longer each day
    - 3 weeks for Sprint 1

Managing PBIs
    - If a PBI is too large then we will break it up into smaller PBIs in cases where they also vary in importance
    - Removing PBIs: if a PBI is deemed unnecessary by the product owner then it will be removed or at least moved down in the Product Backlog
    - Adding PBIs: if more tasks become apparent during our sprint review meeting then they will be added as new PBIs for the next sprint

When is a task done
    - A task is complete when a minimum of two people have reviewed the code and have okayed the submission.
    - A task is complete when it passes all unit tests, acceptance tests, and is committted to the main branch.
    - When it succefully intergrates the feature requested in the User Story.

Scrum Meeting Format
    - Scrum meetings are during Monday meetings
    - Documents will be distributed during monday's scrum meeting, in accordance to what tasks people can handle for that scrum length
    - Tasks/documentation will be organized on Trello

Procedure for our work
    if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here
    - Comments on methods/functions are necessary
    - Start simple with code, then add on later and in between the time period
    - Keep everyone updated on all the code/documentation changes on discord/trello
    - Trello changes need to be confirmed by the members on discord before publishing it on the board
    - If a task is falling behind (you are stuck for an hour or more with no progress) you must let the group members know so we can get
      The project back on track.

Rules
    - Make sure to attend every single daily scrum meeting at the designated time.
    - Make sure to attend every lab section, if you can't then provide a reason as to why.
    - Respond to other team members when they are contacting you in a reasonable time (12 hours), if you can't respond for a period of time
      let the others know ahead of time that you will be temporarily unavailable for an extensive period of time.
    - Make sure you do the tasks that you took on in the previous meeting, if they get stuck for whatever reason then contact the other members
    - Make sure your pull request comments are relevant and appropriate to what you did within the fork.
    - Make sure to attend lectures to be kept up to date on relevant information that is provided during them, if you cannot attend check the 
      recoreding that is archived in the canvas module for past lectures.
    - All deadlines must be met for each task without exception.

    Minor Offenses
        - Missing 1 daily scrum within a week
        - Your pull messages are irrelevant and/or inappropriate.
        - Not doing assignments you were given in a reasonable time, and not contacting/telling other members in the event of a task being stuck.
        - Not communicating with other members about your progress.
        - Missing 1 minor deadline (a daily scrum task), becomes major if any more are missed.

    Major Offenses
        - Missing meeting in lab without contacting the others and working out your responsibilities for the upcoming week
        - Missing at least 3 daily scrum meetings.
        - Missing a strict deadline (assignment due date)
        - 3 different minor offenses within a given week.

How we will handle members who aren't meeting our expectations
    - In the event of a minor offense Someone in our group will talk to the group member who is falling short within 24 hours
      of the minor offense.
    - After the first offense if another is commited within the week of the first offense
      we will give a group warning to the offender 
    - If a major offense or a 3rd minor offense is committed within the same week of the group intervention
      we will get the Scrum Master (TA) involved to consult the member.
    - If all previous attempts to correct the offender's behavior are not successful within the week of the major offense 
      we will get the Product Owner to take action against the offender (Professor Jayson Rock).

We as a team agree to all of these terms and conditions and by signing here we are expected to hold ourselves to these standards.
