Group Charter: Group 3

1.  Availability for meeting expectations:
    We have decided we can meet on these days below:
    - Monday/Wednesday: 3:00pm to 3:20pm,  
    - Friday 2:00pm to 2:20pm.

2.  Response time to communication expectations
    - We hope to get a response from each other within 5 - 10 minutes, to assess and address
      any issues and concerns.

3.  Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)
    - A task is complete when a minimum of two people have reviewed the code and have okayed the submission.
    - A task is complete when it passes all unit tests, acceptance tests, and is committted to the main branch.
    - When it succefully intergrates the feature requested in the User Story.

4.  Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
    - Scrum meetings are during Monday meetings
    - Documents will be distributed during monday's scrum meeting, in accordance to what tasks people can handle for that scrum length
    - Tasks/documentation will be organized on Trello

5.  Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)
    if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here
    - Comments on methods/functions are necessary
    - Start simple with code, then add on later and in between the time period
    - Keep everyone updated on all the code/documentation changes on discord/trello
    - Trello changes need to be confirmed by the members on discord before publishing it on the board
    - If a task is falling behind (you are stuck for an hour or more with no progress) you must let the group members know so we can get
      The project back on track.

6.  Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations
    must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor.
    - Someone in our group will talk to the group member who is falling short.
    - Upon the first warning we will give a group warning with all members involved.
    - If that doesn't work we will get the Scrum Master (TA) involved to consult the member.
    - If all else fails we will get the Product Owner to take action (Professor Jayson Rock).

7.  Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the document.
    - Sotirios Maillis
    - Aaditya Tiwari
