    - Monday/Wednesday: 3:00pm to 3:20pm,  
    - Friday 2:00pm to 2:20pm.

    - We hope to get a response from each other within 5 - 10 minutes, to assess and address
      any issues and concerns.

3.  Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)
    - A task is complete when a minimum of two people have reviewed the code and have okayed the submission.
    - A task is complete when it passes all unit tests, acceptance tests, and is committted to the main branch.
    - When it succefully intergrates the feature requested in the User Story.

4.  Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
    - Scrum meetings are during Monday meetings
    - Documents will be distributed during monday's scrum meeting, in accordance to what tasks people can handle for that scrum length
    - Tasks/documentation will be organized on Trello

5.  Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)
    if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here
    - Comments on methods/functions are necessary
    - Start simple with code, then add on later and in between the time period
    - Keep everyone updated on all the code/documentation changes on discord/trello
    - Trello changes need to be confirmed by the members on discord before publishing it on the board
6.  Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations
    must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor
7.  Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the document.
